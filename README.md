# Python_DjangoREST_Refresh:
  ## Refresher module on REST api development using (TDD, Python, Django, DjangoREST, Docker,Travis-CI, PostgreSQL)
### Intro:
  - The goal of this project is to reboot my skills on building a REST framework. I will be utilizing Python, Django, DjangoREST, Docker, Travis-CI, PostgreSQL. TDD principles will be followed for confidence in my modules, objects, and methods. In addition, I chose to make this module public in the hopes that a) someone else might benefit from any of the code I write for this project, and b) that someone looking for my skills might see some of them here.
